# Debug File

WARNING! FILES ARE UNSTABLE

Please note that all debug files may be out-of-date and their output may therefore differ from the Main files.
Debug files contain debug-only code and may make it extremely hard to play.

Make sure to remove the "Debug_" before each name before executing should you wish to use it.
